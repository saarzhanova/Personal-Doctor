          "message": "Thank you for those details. It’s crucial to manage dehydration early, especially in children with cystic fibrosis. Here’s what we can do right now: Hydration: Start by giving Oliver oral rehydration solutions (ORS) to ensure he stays hydrated. These solutions are specially formulated to replace lost fluids and essential nutrients. Diet Management: For now, avoid high-fiber and dairy products as they might exacerbate his diarrhea. Instead, offer him more digestible foods like rice cereal, bananas, and cooked carrots to help solidify his stools. Rest and Comfort: Make sure Oliver is comfortable and resting. This will help him conserve energy and recover quicker."
